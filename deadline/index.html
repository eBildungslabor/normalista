<h2 id="deadlines-policy">Deadlines policy</h2>

<p>Deadlines are mandatory. You must turn in your assignments before the date and time given to you as a deadline. For each day you miss a deadline you will drop half a grade on your assignment. Plan ahead and remember: done is better than perfect. It will always be better to hand in something than nothing. If you are having trouble with your assignment let me know immediately, do not wait until it is too late. In return you will get feedback about your assignment from me within reasonable time.
Important note: I am waiting to learn from the School if we will use Blackboard for the assignments or you will hand in your assignments by filling out a form. This will be informed to everyone by Week 2. You must name the file of assignment with your last name and date. Example: kissinger_month_day. Always add your byline.</p>
